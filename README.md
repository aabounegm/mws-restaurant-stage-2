#### _Three Stage Course Material Project - Restaurant Reviews_

## Project Overview: Stage 2

For the **Restaurant Reviews** projects, you will incrementally convert a static webpage to a mobile-ready web application. In **Stage One**, you will take a static design that lacks accessibility and convert the design to be responsive on different sized displays and accessible for screen reader use. You will also add a service worker to begin the process of creating a seamless offline experience for your users.

### Specification

You have been provided the code for a restaurant reviews website. The code has a lot of issues. It’s barely usable on a desktop browser, much less a mobile device. It also doesn’t include any standard accessibility features, and it doesn’t work offline at all. Your job is to update the code to resolve these issues while still maintaining the included functionality. 

### What do I do from here?

1. Fork and clone the [server repository](https://github.com/udacity/mws-restaurant-stage-2). You’ll use this development server to develop your project code.
2. Change the data source for your restaurant requests to pull JSON from the server, parse the response and use the response to generate the site UI.
3. Cache the JSON responses for offline use by using the IndexedDB API.
4. Follow the recommendations provided by Lighthouse to achieve the required performance targets.
